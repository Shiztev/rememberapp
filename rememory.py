# Basic note functions - getopt module?

    # Create a note: UI(?) with a few text fields (Start with CLI)
        # possible text fields: subject, time, location, people, items, additional notes

    # Store a note: in a file/SQL(?)
        # could store in one file, each line being one note


# Access note functions - getopt module?

    # 'Read' stored notes: display the notes to review and remember.

    # Edit stored notes: alter the content of a note

    # Delete stored notes: remove notes from storage



# Main function, utilize sys to gather and process args/opts
    #
